/**
 * Desk v2 fixtures (DESK_FRAME3_SPEC §12, §13): one JSON file per endpoint,
 * each exactly the §12 shape (PROPOSED fields per §12.13 included), carrying
 * the mockup's values. They are never imported by the app: the browser always
 * asks /api/desk/*. Two things answer from them instead of the API:
 *   - the Desk browser tests (e2e/lib/desk-fixtures.ts, page.route), and
 *   - the dev server when started with DESK_FIXTURES=1 (vite.config.ts),
 * both through `deskFixture` below, so the two can never disagree.
 * Unit tests import the JSON directly.
