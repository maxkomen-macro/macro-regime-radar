# FRAME3_REPORT.md — Desk v2 build (session A, `desk/frame-3`)

Contract: `docs/desk/DESK_FRAME3_SPEC.md` plus the approved PNGs in
`docs/desk/screens/`. Branch `desk/frame-3`, cut from `desk/frame-2` at
`4c810d3`. Touches `web/` only, plus this report, the compare screenshots in
`docs/desk/screens/compare/` and the PROPOSED fields in the spec's §12.13.
Nothing pushed; no `.db`, `data/`, secrets, `api/`, `src/` or `scripts/`.

## How it was built and checked

- **Fixtures, one per endpoint.** `web/src/fixtures/desk/<endpoint>.json`,
  each the §12 shape with the mockup's values (PROPOSED fields from §12.13
  included). The app never imports them: it always asks `/api/desk/*`.
  One resolver (`web/src/fixtures/desk/index.ts`) answers from them for
  three consumers, so they cannot disagree: the unit tests
  (`web/src/test/desk.ts`), the Desk browser tests (`web/e2e/lib/desk-fixtures.ts`,
  `page.route`) and the dev server when started with `DESK_FIXTURES=1`
  (`web/vite.config.ts`, serve-only middleware, never in a build).
- **Compare shots.** `web/scripts/desk-compare.mjs <route> <png-name>`
  screenshots a tab with Playwright's Chromium at 1440 wide, the approved
  PNG's height, 2× density (the PNGs are 2880 px wide), against
  `DESK_FIXTURES=1 npx vite --port 5193`, and writes
  `compare/<name>.build.png` (the build) and `compare/<name>.png` (design
  left, build right). Geometry was matched by measuring text runs and box
  edges in both images (PIL), not by eye alone.
- **Gates before every commit:** `tsc -b --noEmit`, `vitest run` (whole
  suite), `npm run build`, and the Desk browser tests
  (`E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5193 npx playwright test e2e/desk.spec.ts`).
  The browser tests assert, per built tab: every computed color is a §1.3
  color, no banned word renders, no sideways scroll; plus keyboard stops with
  names and rings, reduced motion, the 390 px menu.
- **Standing checks in the unit suite:** `desk-palette.test.ts` (every color
  literal in the v2 CSS/TSX is a §1.3 color), `desk-language.test.ts` (the
  frame-2 ban list plus "established" and "significant", over the Desk
  sources and every string the fixtures serve).
- **Independent verifier per tab:** a separate agent with no part in the
  build, briefed with the spec section, the PNG, the compare shot, the
  fixtures and the source, asked to fail anything that does not trace to §12.

## Decisions taken unattended

- **D1. Type sizes and geometry follow the PNGs, not §1.2's stated sizes.**
  The PNGs render about 10–15% larger than §1.2 says (they were drawn with
  wider fallback fonts: DejaVu Sans / Mono and a Times-like serif). The PNG
  wins for layout, so sizes were calibrated by matching text-run widths in the
  PNG with Plex / Source Serif 4: body ≈ 14 px, mono labels ≈ 11.5–12 px with
  almost no extra tracking, serif values ≈ 29 px, page title 28 px, sidebar
  189 px wide including its border (§1.1 says 176). Fonts are the spec's.
- **D2. Unbuilt tabs show a one-line placeholder** until their commit; the
  frame-2 pages they replace are removed with the commit that replaces them
  (Today, S&P Internals, the designed shells, the mobile nav and the Build
  Notes copy went with Overview). Old slugs redirect to the v2 tab
  (`today → overview`, `sp-internals → technicals`, …), query kept.
- **D3. Monitored rows sort by room left, least first.** The mockup draws
  68% / 22% / 52% under the words "Sorted by room left"; the footer's claim
  wins over the drawing, and least-room-first matches "what's closest to
  being wrong".
- **D4. Monitored rows take two lines.** §2's one-row grid
  (`minmax(0,1fr) 54px auto 64px 14px`) leaves the name about 60 px at this
  card width; in the mockup the names overlap the NAV column. The build keeps
  the same cells in the same order on two lines (name and `▸`, then NAV,
  room, bar), so every name reads in full.
- **D5. Room between 30% and 50% keeps the neutral text color:** §2 colors
  ≥ 50% green and < 30% amber and names nothing between.
- **D6. The regime name is amber on the Overview tile** (§2's table says
  "amber serif"); the PNG draws it white.
- **D7. The walkthrough** (frame-2) opens from the Overview's Walkthrough
  button, as before; nothing autoplays. Its six steps now point at the v2
  tabs; the Event Study step addresses its question as `?preset=<slug>`,
  mirroring §12.2's parameters.
- **D8. Frame-3's two banned words are enforced on v2 code and every fixture
  string now;** the frame-2 files not yet rebuilt (the event-study engine
  adapter, the frame-2 study components, positions, pipeline) are listed in
  `LEGACY_FRAME2` in `desk-language.test.ts` and keep the frame-2 list until
  their tab lands. The list is reported at the end of this file.
- **D9. One wording for the verdict definitions** (§1.5), shared by Overview
  and the Ledger; the two PNGs word them slightly differently.
- **D10. "Radar" links** (the sidebar's `← MACRO REGIME RADAR` and the
  breadcrumb) go to `/app/dashboard`, the frame-1/frame-2 target.
- **D11. The impeccable design hook's font-size and radius findings** measure
  against `web/DESIGN.md`'s ramp; the v2 Desk follows the frame-3 spec and
  PNGs instead, and the `desk.css` findings are pre-existing frame-2 values.
  Left as they are.
- **D12. Color jobs follow §1.3 where a PNG gives an accent a second job.**
  Only Overheating takes a regime color on the Overview tile and the sidebar
  (amber); red stays for down and negative numbers; the black shadows became
  page-color tints. Where the spec text names a color outright (the Regime
  key in §5, the 50-day line in §3) the text wins over the PNG.
- **D13. The sidebar's `S&P today` reads "today" only when the served session
  is New York's today;** otherwise it names the session ("S&P Sep 22"), so a
  weekend or a stale snapshot never calls an old close today. With the Sep 22
  fixtures the build therefore prints "S&P Sep 22" where the PNG prints
  "S&P today".
- **D14. "Awaiting refresh" means a failed or absent block** (§1.7); while the
  first answer is on its way a card stays quiet (`aria-busy`), so a slow
  answer never reads as a missing one. The verdict type carries §12.2's
  `insufficient` (pill "Too few", dashed gray) so a Ledger or trend row with
  fewer than 10 events renders instead of breaking.

## Tabs

### 1. Overview — `frame-3: overview`

Built: the v2 shell (sidebar as the only navigation with TODAY and HOUSE
DISCIPLINE cards, header with breadcrumb, Desk / Client toggle in the URL and
the tab's one action, aliases for old slugs, the 390 px Menu), the card kit
(`web/src/screens/desk/kit/`), the data layer (`web/src/screens/desk/data/`,
§12 types and one React Query hook per endpoint), and the Overview tab:
since-last-close line, four tiles with Live badges, Active signals with the
three verdict definitions, Monitored rows, both actions. Fixtures:
`overview.json`, `ledger.json`, `technicals.json` (the sidebar reads
`chg_1d`; its price series are shaped so the averages land exactly on 6,280
and 5,910 with crosses near Apr 14 and Jul 1, 2025).

Compare: `docs/desk/screens/compare/01-overview.png` (build alone:
`01-overview.build.png`). Matches on the first calibrated pass; differences
are D3–D6 and the MOCKUP badge (§1.6: not built).

PROPOSED (spec §12.13): `sample_start` on ledger rows, `tiles.vol.band`,
`tiles.trend.date`, `data_status`, the technicals point shape. Notes for B:
the two label spellings, and the mockup rows vs §12.1's filter.

Verifier, round 1: **FAIL** (one blocking finding). Dispositions:
- V-1 (blocking) tone colors lost to later same-specificity rules (room % and
  "Overheating" rendered in the text color): **fixed**, tones scoped under
  `.dk`; the browser test now checks the computed colors.
- V-2 regime colors beyond §1.3: **fixed** (D12).
- V-3 the trend badge dated by the envelope: **fixed** with PROPOSED
  `tiles.trend.date`; the sidebar's "S&P today" is D13.
- V-4 the walkthrough strip in frame-2 colors and offset: **fixed**, v2
  tokens and the 189 px offset; the palette check now runs with `?tour=2`.
- V-5 non-fixture values (null dates, null blocks, p outside the one-in-N
  range, "insufficient", a 0.0 vol change): **fixed**, tolerant formatters and
  a guard per tile.
- V-6 the technicals price series (crossings a day or three off the served
  dates, NYSE holidays as sessions): **deferred to the Technicals commit**,
  which draws that series; the Overview reads only `chg_1d`.
- V-7 a day count off by one in the fixture: **fixed** (31).
- V-8 "Awaiting refresh" while loading: **fixed** (D14).
- V-9 spacing and glyph nits: **fixed** (subtitle gap, first-row offset,
  note spacing and wrap, ▶ caret, toggle and button widths, crumb color).
- V-10 "prove" in the gate prompt and black shadows: **fixed**.
- V-11 two broken references in the spec (§12.1 says `monitored` is "12.7
  compact", the position shape is §12.8; §1.1 cites "§8.3" for the gate
  text, which is §9): **recorded for the spec owner**, not edited (session A
  adds only PROPOSED fields to the spec).

Verifier, round 2: **PASS WITH FINDINGS**, nothing blocking; V-1 to V-8 and
V-10 confirmed fixed (colors sampled from the new shot). Its three nits:
- R2-1 the v2 reset `.dk p { margin: 0 }` out-ranked single-class margins, so
  some calibrated margins never applied: **fixed**, the reset now has zero
  specificity (`:where(...)`), and the sidebar, tiles and Monitored list were
  re-measured against the PNG (within 1–4 px); the note wraps only at its
  separators; the header's toggle and button match the PNG's width.
- R2-2 null `vol.band`, `since_signal`, `vix`, `up_pct`: **fixed**, each is
  guarded and its phrase left out.
- R2-3 the "Too few" pill for `insufficient` is not spec copy: **recorded**
  (D14), for the Ledger tab.

Gates at commit: typecheck clean; unit 105 files, 1,156 tests; build ok;
Desk browser tests 10 of 10.
